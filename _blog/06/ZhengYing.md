**Add a link to your site.**

**Write at least 2-3 sentences describing the problems you encountered while following these instructions, how you solved them, and how you anticipate using this site in the future.**

Years ago, I have tried to build a static site with `hugo` (https://gohugo.io/) and host it on github. Although I have built one site, I did not understand the online totorials/terminologies very well. Now, form the blog 06 instruction, I have the opportunity to learn to build a site from scratch. 

Github an only host one web per account, so I registered another github account to host the new site. The main problem of setting a second github account is to set a second ssh-key-pair and specify which key-pair I need to use in specific repos.

I tried the second method - `blogdown`. I have some problem in using `blogdown::new_post()`. After I read Yihui's tutorial, I tried to click `Tools`-> `addins` to add a post interactively in Rstudio, and successfully added a post.

I also link my old site to the "CV" tab of the main page (I will buld my CV in the future).

I will learn more about the `blogdown`, try different themes, and add interesting things to my site. It is a great experience to build a free static site with `blogdown`.
