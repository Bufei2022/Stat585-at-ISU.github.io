##### Trial and Error

- I ran into the first problem while following the last line of the instruction: to work with the sourse directory in RStudio and to commit the changes with another RStudio project. With Amin's help, I was aware that I should make a change in the source RStudio project, and then can commit them in another project while opening both RStudio projects. In addition to that, I relied on the [reference](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui to add my contents. I think I will revise this website to introduce my future research, and to share my CV.
