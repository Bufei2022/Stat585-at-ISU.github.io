## Instructions:

1. a link to your site (found at https://<your-username>.github.io). 

https://xiyuansun.github.io/



2. Write at least 2-3 sentences describing the problems you encountered while following these instructions, how you solved them, and how you anticipate using this site in the future. 

I played with several different themes. I spent some time understanding the folder structure. I modified the About page.
