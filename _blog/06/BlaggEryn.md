Problems: One problem that I had throughout the blog post was difficulties with the file paths. For a long time my website would not render because the file path wasnâ€™t correct, but after deleting and starting over, I think I got it down. The other thing that I had difficulties with is that I made a whole bunch of pages, but I still cannot figure out where they are on my website. The only one I got to work was the link to my art, which I think is pretty cool. So I am still trouble shooting on that aspect of the webpage. So I will get that updated as I continue to work. I think it has to do with the templete i am using, so more troubleshooting we do.
