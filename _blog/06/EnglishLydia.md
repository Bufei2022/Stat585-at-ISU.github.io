## My Website:

https://lydiapenglish.github.io/

## Challenges:

I stayed simple and used a R markdown website. I found it easy to create the basic files. The customization was the difficult part. It took me a while to figure out how to change the theme successfully - turns out I was just missing an indent in my code (ugh). I also had to look at other people's scripts to figure out how to link to a pdf or a picture - but that was also pretty simple once I figured it out. 

Honestly I would not have created a website if I didn't have to for class so I'm not sure how much I'll use it - but it is helpful to have a public page if I want to keep a current CV and lab interests out there for the public to see.
