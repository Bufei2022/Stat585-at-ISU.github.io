## Problems encountered
There are two problems I encountered. The first was I didn't know how to create .yml file. The way I did was to create a txt file, wrote the content I need and then change its extension to .yml and thankfully it worked. The other problem was I could not open my website after uploading all the needed files. And the reason I found was the filename of homepage should be "index.html" but my file was "Index.html". After I fixed that, everything went well.
