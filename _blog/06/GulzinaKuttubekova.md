1. Link to my personal website launched using GitHub: https://kgulzina.github.io/


2. Write at least 2-3 sentences describing the problems you encountered while following these instructions, how you solved them, and how you anticipate using this site in the future.

    I built my website two months ago with the primary purpose of publishing blogs. By now I have only two pages: "about" and "posts". It was really hard for me to build it with Jekyll, since I did not know there is another rendering engine like Hugo. I think it would be much easier if I built the website following the instructions, rather than trying to do it based on my "own" research. 
    
    I am still having difficulty with adding contacts on the main page. Currently I working on it. 
    
    I am planning to continuously refine my website and use it for academic as well as for industrial purposes.
