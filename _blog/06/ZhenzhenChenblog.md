1. My website: https://tablehen.github.io/

2. The problem I have met:
  1). I want to add a video to my website, and I can add the link(URL) to my website. However, I can not make the video direct show on my website. I want people who view my website can just click the video, it will start play. I try the following code: 
  <video src = "https://720yun.com/t/76djugtmtf8?from=timeline&isappinstalled=0" controls>
  <\video>
  
  But it does not work.
  
  2) When I went to my website the About" page, it does not show any content. I fixed this problem, just because when I made _site.yml file, I used text:"about", href:"About.html". I should be careful about the capital letter and lower case.
