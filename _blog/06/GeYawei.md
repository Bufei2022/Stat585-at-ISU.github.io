**Problem:**

I can't find the blogdown type when creating the project in step3. Then I updated my RStudio, and it was fixed.

**How to use it in future**

I had a github site before which was wrriten in Html when I was trying to learn some html. I heard that we can have only one site like this in github, is that ture? So I deleted the old one to avoid potential problems. 

In the future, I can use this as my homepage, however I have nothing to put on that now. Hopefully, we can achieve something that is valuable enough to share on a homepage in the coming years.
