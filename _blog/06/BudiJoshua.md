My website https://joeybudi.github.io/

Some of my challenges:
- I first did not use my github username as my website address name, that seemed to have caused problems. Kat helped me to identify this problem, somehow github did not like this. I think this could be changed in the future and it would be fun to have a different name for my website address that is not so straightforward my name 
- Also after comparing with Kat, I found that my publishdir address did not need the full length address, it can use the ../ shortcut, in fact it might help to get the whole system working.
- I have been wanting to create my own blog, mainly is going to contain some of my thoughts and observation about agriculture development, i.e., differences that I observe in terms of agricultural systems in the US and in Indonesia or in developing countries. I intend to make as much parallel contrast as possible. 
I would also add some updates of my activites here during my grad student life, research pictures (some of my beautiful ggplot graphics), conferences, travels, etc
