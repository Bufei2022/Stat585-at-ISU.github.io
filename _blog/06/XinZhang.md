- My website:

https://alleansa.github.io

I made this website last summer, but this time I add more sites

- Problems:

Rigth now, I have three problems but I still could not fix them.

1) I'd like to change the name of the website, i.e. when the website is opened, the tag would show 'Xin's Homepage'.

2) In the travelling/map page, I use plotly to show the map with places I visited. But I want to hide the imformation of 'rank', which I used to adjust the bubble size in geom_point.

3) I want to add a page for the blog. But for rmarkdown, it is not quite easy...
