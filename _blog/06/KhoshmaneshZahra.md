#### Link to my blog created by blogdown

Please click [here](https://zahrakhoshmanesh.github.io/) to access my blog and [about me](https://zahrakhoshmanesh.github.io/about/).
I also updated the twiter and github link to my accounts.

####  describing the problems I encountered , how I solved them, and how I anticipate using this site in the future.

1. I usually use html and css to create website. Therefore, at first it was totally strange to me creating a website with using 
intermediate software, here, R and blogdown package. I played around and found the toml file and changed it. Later, It was very fun to create and publish 
contents with using R studio.
2. Since many recruiters check the github of job seeker who wants to work as developer at first, for me it is important to have a website
created on top of my github project to introduce the projects I already worked to people. I am going to use this blog as my primary 
website though I have google website.
