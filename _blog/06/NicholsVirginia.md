## The website

## Reflection/Challenges

I used Rmarkdown website because I'm new at this, and no need to be a masochist. 

I could create my website and look at it using the link in RStudio. But committing ALWAYS made Rstudio freeze. After much googling, I found someone had similar [issues](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-freezes-when-making-initial-commit/3868/2)

So I learned how to commit from the terminal. It was too easy, and I'm sure there is a reason not to do it. I suppose it commits all changes, even things I might usually ignore, but it worked. I opened the terminal, typed 'git commit -m "please don't crash" and voila, I have my website.
