## The learning curve...
Oddly enough, the biggest challenge that I encountered was figuring out how to create a yaml file. I thought that yaml referred soley to the section at the top of Rmd files that lists the title, author, date, and so on. I didn't know there was a .yml file format. I googled variations of "how to create a .yml file for r markdown website" and found many pages that essentially included the instructions of what to include in the .yml file but not how to make the file itself. Playing around in R Studio I, found the dropdown menu that allows you to change the file format of a document.

I also had a smidgen of trouble figuring out how to include a link to a pdf file on my website. I eventually found a helpful site [here](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html) about creating rmarkdown websites that had an example of a link to a pdf.
