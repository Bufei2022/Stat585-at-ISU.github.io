I found the creation of the basic website with Rstudio to be quite easy, but the more difficult part was the personalization of the site. I don't have experience with web design and html/css/etc., so adding things beyond basic text is still confusing for me. This is something that will just be fixed with experience, as there are a ton of resources on how to do everything. Once I decide what I want my site to look like, I can go find out how to do it. I plan on adding some elements that automatically update using information from other websites and my local machine in the future, when time allows. It looks like the blogdown method was a bit more involved and required a more organized file structure, so I can foresee many issues if I ever try that method in the future.
