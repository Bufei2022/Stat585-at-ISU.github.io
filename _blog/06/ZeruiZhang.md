## Site Link: 

Here is the link [https://zeruiz.github.io](https://zeruiz.github.io)


## Problems encountered

I chose `blogdown` to construct a static website. I met my first problem when I tried to use one good template from website. I could not use `build_site()` to initiate the website and figure out nothing through Google search. However, everything worked after I changed the template. My guess is that the very first template I chose might be out-dated and had incompatibility. The second problem was that I did not know how to link my pdf file to the CV button. I put the original file under the static folder and used relative link to connect it.
