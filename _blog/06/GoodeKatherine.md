My website can be found [here](https://goodekat.github.io). 

I decided to try using blogdown to create my website since I have heard many people talk about it. I encountered a handful of problems while creating my website. Here is a list of some of the problems and how I handled them.

- My file structure after step 8 had way more files than the directions showed. There were lots of files relating to example blog posts. When I first encountered these, I was not sure what to do about them. I decided to just keep working, and eventually, I ended up deleting them.
- When I was first trying to edit the about.md file, I could not get my site to update. I think I messed something up when deleting files. I ended up deleting all of my files and starting over. I was more careful to only delete files that the directions suggested. This seemed to fix the problem.
- I tried to change the theme. I followed along with the directions on one of the Hugo theme pages, but I was not able to fully understand the directions. I never got a different theme to work, and eventually, I ended up deleting everything and starting from scratch again. I decided to save this task for another day.
- I wanted to add a paragraph to the homepage of my website. I tried some guess work and some internet searches. I am still so new to creating websites that I was struggling to know what to search for. Eventually, I gave up.
  
I anticipate using this site as a place to display my CV and as a place to post slides for talks that I give.
