# Discussion

I would like to use my website to host professional materials, such as my resume or CV, as well as highlights for projects I'm working on and records of fun or interesting things that I come across. Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time even linking my CV as a pdf to its own tab on my webpage (so I've linked it in my bio text instead). I had difficulties setting up the correct file structure, and I'm not very familiar with how Blogdown builds the html pages. I tried adding an example post, but I couldn't figure out the difference between adding it to the homepage vs the "Posts" tab. I was pretty proud of getting the landing page to show my picture, which involved creating a Gravatar account connected to my personal email address. All in all, I have high hopes for my webpage but it will take some time to get there... :) ðŸ˜„
