## Instructions:

Create a file `LastnameFirstname.Rmd` in the 06 folder of the blog-2019 repository. In that file, add a link to your site (found at https://<your-username>.github.io). Write at least 2-3 sentences describing the problems you encountered while following these instructions, how you solved them, and how you anticipate using this site in the future. 

### Site Link: 

https://oscarm524.github.io

### Issues:

This was my very first time creating a website. It took me a while to get everything working. First, I spent a couple of hours trying to figure out how to include pictures. Also, I struggled for a bit when I was trying to including links. I solved those problems by googling for a couple of hours. I'm planning to improve this site (so I can keep posting other blogs/papers) in the near future because so far it looks very plain and simple.
