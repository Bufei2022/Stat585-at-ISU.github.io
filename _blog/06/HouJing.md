I used the Simple Markdown Site to set up my website. 

## Site Link:
https://jinghou3.github.io

## Issues:
1) First, I never create .yml file before. And there are no options for .yml in the "New File". So I created a text file and then saved as the .yml file. Luckily, this worksÔºÅ

2) After I pushed my site to GitHub, the index.html file worked well, but the website didn't work. I checked all files; finally I found there was a number missing in my repository name compared to my username. What a stupid mistake!

3) So far I have few things to add. In the future, I hope I can have some creative and valuable work to share on my website.
