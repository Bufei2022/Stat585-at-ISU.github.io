## Instructions:

Create a file `LastnameFirstname.Rmd` in the 06 folder of the blog-2019 repository. In that file, add a link to your site (found at https://<your-username>.github.io). Write at least 2-3 sentences describing the problems you encountered while following these instructions, how you solved them, and how you anticipate using this site in the future. 

### Site Link: 
https://jzemmels.github.io

### Issues:

One issue that I was experiencing was understanding the file structure needed to build the site correctly. For example, some of the additions I made to the about.md file wouldn't show up upon pushing the changes to github and the template files that I thought I had deleted were still there. To fix the former, I looked at the sample site that came with Yihui's template and tried to mimic the file structure therein. I'm actually still experiencing issues with the old template files sticking around even after deletion and I'm unsure if I manually deleting them in the jzemmels.github.io folder would fix the problem. The additions I have made don't seem to have updated dates, but I don't see how to change this in Yihui's sample site. Also, I'm still slightly confused by how the config.toml file dictates the layout of the site and how I can, for example, use it to add a link to my CV in the menu bar.

I would like to use this site to publicly catalogue interesting projects that I either come across or work on.
