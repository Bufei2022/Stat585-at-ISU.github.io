- My website: https://minzhang95.github.io/

- Problems and plans:

(1) I couldn't find `.yml` option in the `New` tab in Rstudio. So I created `_site.yml` from a new text file and changed the suffix to `.yml` manually. It worked. 

(2) I find this exercise very useful, because I intended to build my own website anyway. I read through the tutorial of "Creating websites in R" provided by Emily C. Zabor [[link](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html)]--very easy to follow and helpful. 

(3) I plan to continue with this MyWeb R project by completing the `Research` tab afterwards, and adding a `Photo` tab.
