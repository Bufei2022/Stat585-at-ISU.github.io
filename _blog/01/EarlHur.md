1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

The biggest mishap I had from one of my team project was from my final project in Stat480. Even though all the teammates understood the concepts we covered during the classes and were enthusiastic, we often ran into the issue sharing codes with each other. At that time, the only way we could share and modify each others' code was using Dropbox or attaching our code and sending an email to our team. It was very hard for us to figure out exactly which part was modified from others as well. I believe, using Git, this issues could be easily avoided since we could keep and refer to the old version of the code and then check where it was changed. 

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I have been an instructor for Stat226 from the last semester and found out myself enjoying teaching statistics to the students. Chapter 37 would be a very good reference for me to develop and teach a statistics class in the future.
