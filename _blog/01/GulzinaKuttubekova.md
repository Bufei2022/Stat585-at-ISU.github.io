1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**

   There have been many team projects I was involved in and where we had difficulties, such as lack of communication, spending a lot of time on a part which was already completed by another teammate and etc. There is a project I did last year on my own where I had the biggest mishap. It may sound funny, but there was a lack of communication between “yesterday” and “today” Gulzina. During that semester, I was taking four different classes and doing teaching assistantship at the same time. Obviously, I had a lot on my plate. 
For the statXXX final project, I had to iterate a lot because there was always “last-minute” changes requested. Towards the deadline, I had a bunch of files which looked like “statXXX_finalproject_final!!!!!_final!!!!!!!!.pdf” 
The biggest mishap was when I forgot corrections I had made one day before the deadline and submitted a version old file.
Looking back, I realize that I could have resolved the issue by keeping track of version changes with short descriptions.
And the git “change-add-commit” feature just does that!



2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**

   The feature of git I liked the most while reading Jenny Bryan’s book is the usage of  SSH key’s. By creating a pair of public-private SSH keys, we can secure the way of logging into the GitHub server and protect vulnerable project files. Relying on my cryptography knowledge, I know how secure the algorithm of protecting information is. Moreover, I learned that one can increase security by hashing, i.e. paraphrasing, the private key. The final advantage of using SSH keys, we don’t have to enter the user name and password everytime we pull/push updates. We can just use a passphrase instead!
