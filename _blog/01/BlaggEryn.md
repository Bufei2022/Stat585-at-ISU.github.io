1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

I haven’t done a lot of group projects that require a lot of coding, so it is hard for me to thing of a specific mishap, but something that I find really annoying is compiling everyone’s individual work into a cohesive final project. It seems that this always falls on one person. Git would make it useful to have all the work on one document in the cloud, however it would have to be done really carefully as to avoid merge conflicts. So I don’t know if compiling everyone’s work would be that much improved with Git, but I think the placement of everything in one place through Git would help. 

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

One thing that I learned from Bryan’s book is that it is better to keep in touch with the master often. It is better to be committing, pushing, and integrating more often, not less. This does not eliminate the need to integrate different lines of work, but it makes each integration smaller, less burdensome, and less prone to error, this way you are staying in touch with what others are doing and do not fall behind on what the master looks like.
