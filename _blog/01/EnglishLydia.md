Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
I've been lucky enough to not have any major misshaps in group projects. However, git and version control in general still could have been helpful in a number of cases. Last semester I worked on a group paper using GoogleDocs and we had some issues with people editing *downloaded* documents simultaneously, which meant we had to manually merge those files later. Things would have probably been easier had we used git to fork and merge those documents. 
2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
I read Chapter 24 about the repeated ammend - in which you can make many small commits under the same title before pushing work to the remote repository. This is especially helpful in situations where you'd like to commit often - perhaps you're working on something dicey - but don't want to see your git history clogged up with many different commits, all with unique names. I think this feature will be useful for some of my future projects.
