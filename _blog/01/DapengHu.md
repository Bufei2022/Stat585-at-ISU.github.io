1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

I used cybox as my main platform for storing and sharing team projects. One good thing about cybox is that it's also an version control system from which you can view and download previous versions of files. But the pain is that it does not have commit function which means you have no idea what changes have been made. Everytime I upload new version of files, I have to email others what has been changed. Although it sounds not like a mishap, it really annoys me. I think this problem can be easily solved in git since it has the commit function to allow you describe the changes you make everytime. 



2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I am interested in Chapter 12

A new feature that I learned is to connect RStudio to git and github. It's really convenient for me to clone github repository via RStudio and edit files in RStudio. The Git tab in RStudio makes commit and push easily. I can't wait to start my next project using github.
