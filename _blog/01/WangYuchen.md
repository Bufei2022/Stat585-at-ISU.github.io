Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
In one of my projects, I was working on coding part and my co-worker was working on cleaning the data. Both of us needed to run the codes to fix the bug in the codes or fix the data. However, sometimes, after I did some change to the code and told my team-mate, she had already use the results from the old cold to do something more. I had to stop her and made her go back. If we used Github, this problem wouldn't happen. 

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
R can be used with git and github since there is the R package development community. We can use the latest R package and even fix the bug and let others know.
