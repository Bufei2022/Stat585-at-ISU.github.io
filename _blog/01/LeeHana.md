1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
Until finalizing my research, I had to keep revising my code even for one year, At that time, I wanted to leave all of my code for the course of analysis regardless of whether the analysis was indeed used or not at the end. Consequently, the final version of my code was really long since it had some part I decided not to include in my paper, but might be useful for the reference later in some ways. Now I think that if I have used git, I could have recorded the part of code only including the necessary part for the final analysis, and kept track of the entire code for my reference as well.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
Connecting RStudio to Git and GitHub appears to be interesting because with that function, I would not need to copy and paste my code from R to my repo.
