1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided 
using git? How?**. 

Among all projects I have been involved in during my studies, I will always probably  remember two of them due to one main reason, the time
and energy I wasted because I did not know how to save my files instantly on a server.
The frist one goes back to one of my undergraduate projects for experimental design course. The problem was that my computer was not much 
powerful, and it suddenly got shut down time to time. The night before the due date of the project it shut down forever, and I did not have
access to the latest version of the report; however, I had some copies on my email and I had to reopen that old version and reprepare  the
report, which took me some painful hours. Back then, GitHub did not exist (I suppose) although it would have been helpful not to waste 
my time and energy. 

The other one was the final project for STAT 579. Our major problem was that all team members were working on the same R markdown file 
and merging the changes was quite challenging. Then using a repository on GitHub made the job easier with higher performance in a 
time-efficient way on the dead week.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I have read chapter 12 of Briyan's book, 'Connect RStudio to Git', which helped me use my RStudio to make any changes on my repository on 
GitHub via RStudio session itself. I was already familiar with `githubdesktop`, but it is useful to make changes in my local repository. 
After I read this chapter of the book, I learned how to pull from and push to GitHub from RStudio. The steps to make that connection is 
simple and now I can make local changes, save or commit via my RStudio session simply by modifying `README.md` file.
