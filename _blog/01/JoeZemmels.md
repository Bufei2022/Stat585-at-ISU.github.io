## Background:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from http://happygitwithr.com/. Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**.

In the final year of my undergraduate program I took a course on functional programming for data analysis in Python. Our final project was to work in teams of 4 to complete a series of data cleaning and munging tasks on a dataset that was too large to fit into working memory using the functional programming paradigm. The largest hurdle we faced for the project wasn't the the assignment itself, but ensuring that the individual parts of the project that each of us worked on would fit together to form a cohesive whole. Luckily, we were able to avoid many of the pitfalls of data cleaning such as inconsistent variable names with frequent communication, but I firmly believe that using git and GitHub would have made the overall process much smoother. In particular, we would have been able to start the project with the "cohesive whole" mindset and work on the same document rather than pasting our pieces together at the end of the project. We would also have been able to catch or avoid issues like inconsistent variable names easily. Having learned significantly more about GitHub since that class, I plan on never working on such a project without using the git framework.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

While not explicitly a git "feature", I found Chapter 24 on "The Repeated Amend" to be a very useful philosophy with which to approach working within the git framework. In my past uses of git, I have undeniably been the culprit of premature pushing that I later regret. Quite honestly, I have historically lumped committing and pushing together as a single step. Using the commit function as a breadcrumb trail by which I can retrace my steps is certainly something that I plan on working into my git habits in the future. It was also extremely helpful to learn about different strategies for dealing with premature pushing such as the git reset command.
