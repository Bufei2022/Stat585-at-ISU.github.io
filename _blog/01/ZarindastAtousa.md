1.Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.

On my previous experience in a group project i have not involved in group coding with other people and usually the coding part would get separated and assigned to different people, however given my own experience with github i think we could use github for training and learning purpose.I think it could make teaching material alot easier. First by decreasing the time needed to share the document between people and everybody would have access to a share code file which is also compatible with R. Second the access structure of this git helps with saving the files and making sure its not ruined by users.



2.Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book..
I read chapter ; why git?
It is a platform that makes it easy for people to effectivelty collaborate to share and edit files, source codes. It helps with revisioning the push and pull features make it easy to track changes. I just found that multiple people can work on different parts of a project or issue and merge it back to the main development branch.
