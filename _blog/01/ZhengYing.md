#### **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**

Gitlab/github are lifesaver of my individual work. I need to write scripts for data analysis and also to update those scripts frequently to meet different requirements. Prior to knowing git, I had to save all the old versions of scripts when I revised something, which was messy and inefficient. Furthermore, even with all the previous versions of scripts at hand, it is not easy to check where the file has been modified. Moreover, without using version control tools, is hard to back up the codes and keep files up-to-date on local computers and servers. Beside individual usage, the great power of git allows the cooperation and communication with others, which I am not familiar with and eagerly want to learn from the class STAT585.

By the way, my lab has a mixture of wet and dry tasks. Some students are not familiar with command lines and git tools, and thus I have to email them codes. The Rstudio provides an easier interface to use git and flat the learning curve for beginners.

#### **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.


I usually use git in command line (terminal) and web browser. By reading the Chapters 12 and 13 of Jenny Bryan's book, I have learned the setting and basic git operations in Rstudio, such as commit, pull, push. It is easy to use git in GUI by clicking the buttons. It is also helpful to use git to communicate with my lab mates who have no experience of using command lines.
