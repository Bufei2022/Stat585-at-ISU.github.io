Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
I haven't had any, knock on wood. I am terrified of git, though. 
2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
An SSH key? Someday I hope to be able to use that (for advanced users only, apparently).
