Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

The most frustrating problem in a team-based project would be a poor change management. While revising a final report, each member did a lot of things to update the report, but there is always someone who forgot to save to file, sends an old version to colleauges and so on. This could be improved by using programs such as Google Docs, but the best strategy would be using Github. For example, Github allows us to keep old versions just in case, add a short memo to colleagues on what have actually changed compared to previous versions. 


2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
Branches in Chapter 22. I had a experience of overwriting a file while trying something new. I could have avoided the tragic accident if I was aware of Braching in Github.
