Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

    Long long ago, I was working on making R plots, and my teammates worked on writing report. We used ShareLaTeX that I could put R results in the report while they are writing it. Maybe git could also do such thing.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

    I learned how to connect RStudio to Git from the Chapter 12. Awesome!
