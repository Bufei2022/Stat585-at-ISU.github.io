#### Question 1: Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?

Back in 2012, when I was a senior in Colorado School of Mines (Golden, Colorado), my team has to work on group data analysis project. Long story short, we eneded up duplicating some of the analysis, which was a waste of time and effort. On the top of that, the team member who was responsible for writing the last version of the report, his computer broke down two days before the project due date. It was a very stressful experience. Luckily for us, the computer was fixable, and we were able to recover all the project information. Obviously, me and my team didn't know about github back then. This situation is easily avoided by using github. Because we would be able to work in more efficient manner (not wasting time working independently and duplicating other's work). Also, we wouldn't have to experience the stressful experience of the computer being broken and having no access to the project report. 


#### Question 2: Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.

Being a very new GitHub user, I read chapter 9 of Jenny Bryan's boo, which is labeled as Connect to GitHub. This chapter walks you through how to connect your local computer with GitHub. That is, modifying your documents/code in your local machine and then commit and finally push.
