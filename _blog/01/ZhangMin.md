#### Question 1: Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?

When I worked on a course work project, survey sampling for the city bus punctuality in Madison, in my junior year in 2015, I collaborated with three other classmates. We were each responsible for some parts of the final report, and we wrote each piece locally on our own laptops. The most annoying thing of the final touch was that we did not have a shared document where we could edit simultaneously. I might have been editing on version 3, while my teammate sent version 4 for us to review when I was typing. So the last night before the due date was just a complete redo of many things. 

Google Doc could be a life saver, except for the inconvenience of inserting formulas. With the help of GitHub, we also could have worked with Latex locally, and pulled (pushed) from (to) the remote before (after) each edit. 


#### Question 2: Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.

By reading Chapter 09 Connect to GitHub and Chapter 15 New project GitHub first, I leaned how to commit, pull, and push from the shell and RStudio.

In terminal, it’s 

1. Clone the repo to local: git clone URL

2. Make a local change

3. Commit and push: git add -A, git commit -m, git push

In Rstudio, it’s simple clicks with the buttons. But do remember to push in order to see updates online.
