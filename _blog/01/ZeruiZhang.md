1. # Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.

Previously, I worked on a class project doing data analysis with two other students. We all agreed that meeting and discussing in reality could help us work efficiently since we could use AirDrop to communicate the codes and files, and explain to each other directly. However, we found it difficult to coordinate the available time for three persons, especially during the final week when we all had our own schedules. If we use git, we can work on our own parts at the time that suits us best. Git will also record every single change we make to the code and the report, so actually we can work together more efficiently even without meeting and saying a word.


2. # Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryanâ€™s book..

Chapter 22 provides an appealing feature, branch and merge, by which we could work in parallel. This is useful when we want to write and test different parts of a tedious code and try not to affect the other parts. And more than one person could work on the different extensions of the main stream at the same time.
