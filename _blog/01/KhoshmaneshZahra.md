## Reading:
I read chapter 12:Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub of the book "Happy git and Github for the useR".

## Questions

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**.

the biggest problem that I encountered with it in all of the team project was weak communication between project or team members. Imagine in the first day we decide to work on a few part of project. However in the end of day, some people worked on the same part and cause to have redone in a part and does not touch many parts. Definitely It can be solved with using git and appropriate commit. Since using git, team member can see which part other people work on and synchoronize with them and also nothing will be lost.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

Connecting R studio with git, Run classroom with help of git and search the github are the new features that I learned from Jenny Bryan's book.
