1. About possible usage of Git in my previous projects

I have done couples of data analysis projects before without using Git. The biggest mishap is that, sometimes, in a group, we have a teammate who was good at programming and did much of us programming work. However, we couldn’t have a very convenient and efficient way of sharing and gathering code so that other teammates couldn’t learn well from that guy’s code and found it hard to contribute. By using Git and Github, we could have had better platform to cooperate during the projects and everyone can learn from each other instead of separately doing their own work and meeting only at the end.

2. A Git new feature I learned about from the Book

I read the first Chapter of the book, “Why Git? Why GitHub?”.  I learned that GitHub can help us tracking some heavily used packages. If we rely on those packages heavily in R and in our reasearch, we could follow those authors in GitHub and notice any significant changes when it happens. This is a very important application of Git and GitHub.
