### 1.Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.

Back to two years ago, we worked in team for a course project. At the mid-term of the project, we tried different traditional methods and got results on different method. Later, we updated our analysis using more advanced method and got the best result, thus we only focused on this analysis as our result. However, a serious bug was detected at the final stage, making the method a bad choice. Therefore, we should use the code yielding the best performance within the previous analysis. However, we could not figure out which code (version of the code) correspond to the best analysis result since there are so many code and version of similar code.  In the end, we wasted a lot of time to rerun everything again for identifying the corresponding code with the best output.  With GitHub, we should able to easily go back to any stage of the analysis. 

### 2.Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book..

From chapter 12, we can Connect Rstudio to GitHub and this should be very useful since we work in R a lot.
