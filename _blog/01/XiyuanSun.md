## Background:

git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from http://happygitwithr.com/. Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 


Last semester, I was one of the four graduate students as a team working on PFG Capstone Project. We wrote our scripts on AWS with different directories, which made it unconvenient to check each others' code. With git, we could utilize the code review feature. 


2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I am interested in the 32.2 Fork and pull.

Usually I just forked the Github repo I am insterested to make some improvements on, then set up a new version control project on my local computer working on it, and push it to my OWN master branch. According to Jane's book, we could extend that by making pulling request to the original repo. We would also need this for this first blog post exercise. It's a new way for me to collaborate with other repo owners.
