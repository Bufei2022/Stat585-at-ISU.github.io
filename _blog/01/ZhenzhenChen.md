Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 
The biggest mishap I had met for my team project was we could not track for everyone's contributes to the project. Furthermore, it is also hard for us to know the changing part that one person made for the project. Once the project getting more and more complex, it is difficult to notice the little change for one group member to edit the project. I think it can be solved by using git since it can keep track everyone's contribution, and record the everyone's work.


2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.
From Jenny Bryan's book, I am interested in Chapter 5 and Chapter 14. It is a very useful tool for me to do future research. I can update the newest version of the RStudio and packages, and I also can keep track and save for the changing of my research.
