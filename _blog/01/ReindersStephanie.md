Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

All the major team project mishaps that I can think of had more to do with inter-personal communication, for example I for one of my jobs after college, I was on a team with four other introverts. We had the most painful team meetings because no one wanted to be the first person to talk. Git couldn't have helped us, unless perhaps we didn't meet in person and instead only communicated through git. 

My STAT 480 team final project, could have benefitted from git. Each team member ended up writing their own chunks of r markdown code, and I manually pieced it all together to make it run. This wasn't a major mishap by any means, and we all enjoyed the project and working as a team, but git could have made some of the process less cumbersome. 


2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I have been using BitBucket for my research for about a year now. All that time I have used SourceTree to do all of my BitBucket interactions, but until reading Jenny Bryan's book I hadn't realized that I could use SourceTree as an IDE for GitHub; I thought SourceTree was specific to BitBucket. 

This isn't a git feature, but I found it strangely comforting and encouracing that Jenny Bryan's books is up front about the fact that learning git, GitHub, and R is painful and confusing. As I have struggled to learn how to use SourceTree over the past year, all the online tutorials I have found portray SourceTree as simple, straightforward, and so easy a toddler could use it. This portrayal distinctly unhelpful, as I have found SourceTree to be super confusing.
