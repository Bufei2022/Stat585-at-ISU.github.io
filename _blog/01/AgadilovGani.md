Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

Overall, several obstacles we have met when I involved in team projects. For example, the main issue that is sharing and keeping the original version of the project. In addition, we could not monitor the contribution of every team members to the project. Unfortunately, sometimes team members had a different version of the software and it was difficult to integrate the script together. We used online folders to collaborate in order to coordinate the team activity. I am sure that if we use the git, it would be more productive and enhance the organization of the project. Moreover, the team members would have the opportunity to modify the copy of the projects without modifying the original version of the work.  



2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

I have read Chapter 9 from Jenny Bryanâ€™s book where we can learn how to pull from and push to GitHub from your computer. It was really helpful to understand how it actually works. After creating the new repository, by using git clone you can clone it onto your local computer which helps you to make changes, commit and push locally. In addition, when you finish the changes it can be deleted from the local workplace without deleting the original version of the repository.
