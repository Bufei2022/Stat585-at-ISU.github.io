1. Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?

One of the biggest mishaps I had in team projects is that the new uploaded file would cover the previous file on the shared folder. This makes it hard to find the previous file if there are something wrong with the new file. With Git, we can easily recover the previous file and revoke the wrong operation.

2.	Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryanâ€™s book.

I study Chapter 23 about remote repository. In this chapter, the author introduces several commands about how to list existing remotes, add a remote, fetch from and push to remote etc. These operations can help us have a better teamwork.
