1. **Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?**. 

I don't have any team project involved in group coding with other people. The biggest problem I had is how to get the latest version. Last semester I had a three people group project using GoogleDocs. One of our team members still revised his part at midnight before the due day, and he forgot to upload his final file. So on our report day when I opened the latest file on GoogleDocs and prepared to start, he told us the final file was in his laptop. After he copied the file from his laptop with Windows to my Macbook, number one showed up before all the page number. Then he corrected all the page number manually. Unfortunately, our report delayed at least 5 mins. 
From this course, I learn git is a version control system, and it is very useful for collaborative coding project and also helpful for our single working on the computer. Git is a good choice for future work.

2. **Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan's book.**.

 As a totally new user for git, I read chapter 9 and chapter 12. I learned how to connect RStudio to GitHub, how make a repo and clone the repo to my local computer, and how to make a local change, commit, and push.
