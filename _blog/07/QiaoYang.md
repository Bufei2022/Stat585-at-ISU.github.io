Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **Under what license does R operate?**

    GNU General Public License, either Version 2, June 1991 or Version 3, June 2007.

2. **Answer the three questions listed above for the licenses: MIT, GPL-3,  LGPL-3, and CC-0. Note that some of the questions might not be answered with a simple yes/no. In that case, go into more detail, but do not just copy the terms of the license.**

    - [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT): Yes, must include the license. Yes, must include the license. No one, no warranty.
    - [GPL-3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0): Yes, must open source code. Yes, must open source code. No one, no warranty.
    - [LGPL-3](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0): Yes, must open source code (no need to open source if just link). Yes, must open source code. No one, I cannot find it.
    - [CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/): Yes. Yes. No one, no warranty.
    
3. **Assume that you are in the process of making a package for your own graduate work. Describe considerations that come into play in deciding on a license. In case you are not quite at that stage in your graduate studies yet, come up with a likely scenario. Describe it and discuss.**

    Whether I want to release my source code. If I don't want to, I have to link library under LGPL without modification. Otherwise, I can use both GPL and LGPL libraries.
