## Background

Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
I pick the paper "An ontology-based method for assessing batch effect adjustment approaches" since there has one similar article with already published and use the similar approaches with different name to deal with batch effect.  
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
I like rule 7:Always Store Raw Data behind Plots, since if raw data behind figures are stored in a systematic manner, so as to allow raw data for a given figure to be easily retrieved, one can simply modify the plotting procedure, instead of having to redo the whole analysis.
Rule 5: Record All Intermediate Results, When Possible in Standardized Formats, I suppose this one is useless and unlikely to follow as it needs lots of work and waste of time when doing a project. 
## Instructions:

Update your forked version of the 'blog-2019' repository (or re-fork it after deleting your previous repo).

Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post! 

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository. Do not commit the compiled HTML file to the repository.
