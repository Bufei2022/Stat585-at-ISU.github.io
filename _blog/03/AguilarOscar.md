1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

I picked the acticle called: ''Facilitating debugging of web applications through recording reduction'' published by Empirical Software Engineering journal on May 2017. In this paper, the authors claimed that their methodology helps software engineers to debug web applications in a efficient manner. The authors were able to make that claim based on the results of four empirical studies in which their methodology was applied. However, after the paper was published, University of Nebraska-Lincoln started an investigation the results shown in the paper. The results of the investigation showed that the authors manipulated data to show that their methodology works. After that, the authors have retracted. 

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rules 1, 7 and 8 are the rules that I've been following since I started graduate school (I'm planning to follow these rule for the rest of my professional career.) On the other hand, rule 10 is the one that I'm struggling with these days. That is why I decided to take this class, so I can learn more about github with the goal of making results and code from my research available to anyone that is interested.
