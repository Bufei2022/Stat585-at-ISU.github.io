1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The article that I picked was ''Lower Buffet Price Lead to Less Taste Satisfaction''. It seemed like the author, Brian Wansink, was infamous of being retracted, even though he is a well known american researcher in consumer behavior. Cornell University reported that the article has a numerous instances in statistical analysis. The university suggested him to revise his paper with appropriate statistical procedure.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rule 7: Always Share Raw Data behind Plots. This rule might be the easiest one to follow. Storing and not changing the raw data has been one of the most important steps in statistical analysis. Even though we need only a part of data, we never change raw data itself.
Rule 2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps, This might be the hardest one to follow. Actually, for my research, I already violated this rule by removing a few unreadable data and by adding some more information that I found about each observations. Manipulating data manually takes lots of time but we can make mistake doing this as well.
