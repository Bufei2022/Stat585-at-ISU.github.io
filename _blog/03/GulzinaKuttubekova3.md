1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong.**

  After reading an article in FiveThirtyEight about two UC Berkeley graduate students, who investigated and found out that the results of research, as well as the data, were fabricated, I was shocked. Being skeptic in a real life, I would never think people in academia would do such things to gain popularity, or whatever is the intended goal. Now, I am familiar with this kind of acts. And they not just exist, but they are continuously being recorded in Retraction Watch website almost every day! <br>
  One of the interesting cases from this website which caught my attention is the paper by researchers in Thailand, which is to be retracted by food packaging journal. This paper is claimed to be a duplicate of a virtually identical article of theirs. In other words, it is also called “self-plagiarism”. It is been reported that there is a large amount of textual overlap between the new and already published article of the same author. A warning message has been sent to the author, and he responded to the message by his intention to withdraw his paper from the system.


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

  The rule 4: Version Control All Custom Scripts is the easiest rule to follow, in my opinion. I agree with the authors that even the slightest changes to the code may generate totally different, unpredicted results. If one (reviewer of the article) in the future would like to backtrack the output to the code state that gave a certain result, he may find it impossible. To avoid those consequences authors suggest to keep track of any changes to the code by a version control system (eg. git). I want to note that I am already following this rule while conducting CC research. <br>
  Along with that, I think the rule 3: Archive the Exact Versions of All External Programs Used is the hardest rule to follow. While it is helpful to keep track of all programs you used in generating certain outputs, it is hard to retain i.e archive the exact versions of those programs. For me, it would be space/memory wasting, especially if a certain program is very large (in terms of memory). If a researcher used many programs, which are being updated frequently, I would suggest recording the exact version of the program, not the program itself. If one in the future would like to reproduce the study, he should be able to find “that exact” version of the program, as a part of his research.
