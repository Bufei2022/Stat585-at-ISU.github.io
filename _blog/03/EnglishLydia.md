Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
"Lizards could be warming faster than climate" is a 2015 article published in *Ecography* that was retracted the same year due to incorrect methodology. The authors botched their calculations of the operative temperatures in lizards, with the result that their overall conclusions and claims, that lizards were vastly more sensitive to temperature change than previously thought, were incorrect. 
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
I'm working to follow Rule #2 in all my projects. I only resist when I find it difficult to write a script or a function for something that I could easily do by hand. I had one supervisor who was very good at instilling protocols to minimize errors. If data had to be entered manually then two people would do it and their spreadsheets would be compared by a program to look for inconsistencies. It's important to realize that even careful humans err and that programs will create less headaches in the long run.   
I haven't conducted analyses that include randomness and therefore hadn't considered Rule #6 before, which states that one must include the initial seed when performing analyses with randomness so that someone else can produce identical results. If I ever perform an analysis that fits into this catagory I will try and remember this rule.
