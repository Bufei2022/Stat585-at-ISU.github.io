1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong.**

The paper entitled "Corporate social responsibility in purchasing and supply chain" in the Journal of Business Ethics (2009), 85:355–370 was found that is identical to earlier publication by the the same author "Mohammad Asif Salam" under name of ‘‘Social responsibility in purchasing: the case of Thailand’’ in the International Journal of Procurement Management (2007), 1:97–116. The author was banned for publishing any papers for 5 years.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rule1 keeping track of every produced result, because after some time i would forget whats going on and i would need to work with it again meanwhile im working on other project so if i could have a good explanation for every step later following it would be easier.
Rule 2 always having computer doing calculation is better but i would keep track of the result if they are meaningfull
Rule 4 version controling so that we could be able to keep track of how things evolved to what they have become (really important)
Rule 7 keeping the data behind a figure is important to keep track of what figure represents what
Rule 9 textual explaination fo reach result so that the highlights and the interpretation in there after a while i would forget what was the problem as im facing it i should write about it
