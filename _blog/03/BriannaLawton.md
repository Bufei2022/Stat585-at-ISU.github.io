1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

## Q1 Response

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) retracted a 2016 paper on suicide due to errors in the paper concerning the miscategorization of the occupation "farmer" which skewed results due to errors in the analysis.   
The CDC's initial article published, "Suicide Rates by Occupational Group - 17 States, 2012" claimed that farmers were at particularly high risk of suicide. This result raised issue with a website called "The New Food Economy (TNFE)" due to what they said was "the misclassification of farmer suicides in a way that significantly inflated the rate of these events." TNFE mentioned that they had raised concerns about the error early before.
The issue arose due to the discrepency of what a "farmer" occupation was considered versus an individual who "works in agriculture."

The CDC investigated the study and after reaching a complete analysis, decided to retract the original report because the corrections changed the conclusions. One of the main corrected errors was the manual misclassification of some occupation codes in the earlier report (e.g., erroneous coding of farmers to the Farming, Fishing, and Forestry major occupational group instead of to the correct Management major occupational group), which led to errors in reporting of suicide numbers and rates in some groups.

This incident of retraction helped the CDC look into other papers/articles that could have misrepresented data and drawn false or skewed conclusions.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

## Q2 Response

After reading the paper, "Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research" by Sandve et al., I am most likely to follow Rule #1: For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced because I am a very detailed person and I already have a habit of writing down or documenting my workflow process of how I came to achieve something. 
After reading the paper, I find Rule #2: Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps to be hard to follow for because sometimes I can be very convetional and not rely on the updated, efficient method of solving a problem. I will learn to make a habit of avoiding manual data manipulation due to human error that could disrupt or cause errors later down the road in my project study.
