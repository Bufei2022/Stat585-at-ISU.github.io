Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 
An extreme example is summarised in the article titled 'Researcher banned from federal Canadian funding after 
misconduct loses medical license. I am always a little hesitant to judge people doing research in the medical field too harshy. A podcast by Malcolm Gladwell titled 'The imaginary crimes of Margit Hamosh' explores how badly false accusations can harm a researcher, and how false accusations CAN occur. Unfortunately I think data falsification happens in a lot of fields that don't undergo the scrutiny of medical fields, and medical fields are under an immense amount of pressure to produce results. I think the retraction watch demonstrates a flawed system with twisted incentives and a systemic culture of exploitation in research. 

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I can easily follow Rule #2, as it seems like a no-brainer. Avoid manual data manipulation steps! I got in an argument with a collegue about this last summer, and I'm not sure our relationship has recovered. I know it's frustrating for people who don't use R to be told not to touch the data because I want my magical R program to do everything, but I wish I had read this paper before so I could have cited my rules - maybe we'd still be friends. 

Rule #4 is becoming part of my routine. Using git (or just v1, v2, etc.) to keep track of code files is helpful. Even if I do an analysis I never want to use or think about again, it's good to keep records. It IS a little overwhelming to navigate all the commits, but I think I will get used to it.
