Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**.

    [The IR1152 mutant insulin receptor selectively impairs insulin action in skeletal muscle but not in liver](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/68/2/464.1). It has several image duplication, which appear to be identical images.
    
2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

    Most likely to follow Rule 1. I will check every steps to make them correct after I write or execute. Rule 4 is hard to follow, since remembering the idea behind different versions is hard.
