1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**.

The journal Nature published a paper in 2011 entitiled "Selective killing of cancer cells by a small molecule targeting the stress response to ROS" that describes a compound extracted from a pepper plant that appeared to kill cancer cells but leave healthy cells unscathed. While the paper received some media attention, so too did it receive criticism regarding some of the figures used in the paper. For example, one of the figures showed mice with massive tumors, indicating that the mice may have experienced a considerable amount of distress during the experiment. The authors also failed to produce the original data for some of the figures and had to release two corrections in 2012 and 2015. Nature decided to retract the paper in 2018 saying that they had "concerns regarding the integrity of the figures" and that "all these issues in aggregate undermine the confidence in the integrity of this study." What is particularly noteworthy about this retraction is that the paper has been cited 577 times since being published. It is classified as a "highly cited paper," meaning that it was ranked in the top 1 percent of all papers in its field for the year it was published.

2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

Rule #9 that describes connecting textual statements to underlying results is what I will, or at least hope to, follow most closely. When trying to understand a new concept I always find it incredibly effective to have both its textual description as well as a supportive visualization or connection to theory. In learning how to use R markdown and Sweave in the RStudio environment, I think it will be incredibly easy for me in the future to cleanly organize results for for future reference.

A rule that I foresee struggling with is Rule #1 on keeping track of the steps that went into the production of a final result. I have a frequent habit of making changes to something I write, be it code or prose, only to regret the changes made and attempt to revert to a previous state. Oftentimes I am unable to remember or reproduce what I had originally written. In the case of code, this can sometimes lead to completely different results than what would have been produced originally. With reproducibility in-mind, this is clearly less than desirable. In the future, I think putting more reliance on version-control systems like git and developing the habit of frequently saving/committing will help combat this problem.
