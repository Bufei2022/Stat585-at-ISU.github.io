## Background:

## Prompt:


In May 2015 Science retracted - without consent of the lead author - a paper on  how canvassers can sway people's opinions about gay marriage,

The Science Editor-in-Chief cited as reasons for the retraction that the original survey data was not made available for independent reproduction of results, that survey incentives were misrepresented and that statements made about sponsorships turned out to be incorrect.<br>
The investigation resulting in the retraction was triggered by two  Berkeley grad students who attempted to replicate the study and discovered that the data must have been faked.
 
[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-two-grad-students-uncovered-michael-lacour-fraud-and-a-way-to-change-opinions-on-transgender-rights/) has published an article with more details on the two Berkeley students' work.

Malicious changes to the data such as in the LaCour case are hard to prevent, but more rigorous checks should be built into the scientific publishing system. All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). 

Read the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

The New England Journal of Medicine has retracted a 2013 paper that provided some proof that the Mediterranean diet can directly prevent heart attacks, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. The original paper, **Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet**, has been cited 1759 times, according to Clarivate Analytics Web of Science.

The New England Journal of Medicine retracted the paper because of problems in the way the study was carried out. The revised paper says only that people eating the Mediterranean diet had fewer strokes and heart attacks, not as the original paper claimed, that the diet was the direct cause of those health benefits.

The Mediterranean diet paper is being retracted because it turns out Carlisle was correct. When the lead author of the paper, Dr. Miguel Ángel Martínez González of the University of Navarra Medical School, saw Carlisle's analysis, he conducted a detailed audit of the study and quickly noticed some problems.It turns out approximately 14 percent of the more than 7,400 study participants hadn't been **assigned randomly** to either the Mediterranean diet or a low-fat one. When couples joined the study together, both had been picked to follow the same diet. At one of the 11 participating study sites, the lead investigator had assigned the same diet to an entire village and didn't tell the rest of the investigators.Because everybody wasn't randomly assigned to different groups, the study can no longer claim the diet directly caused those health benefits.


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**

I am most likely to follow Rule 2. Whenever possible, I'd rely on the execution of programs instead of manual procedures to modify data.
Such mannual procedures are not only inefficient and error-prone, they are also difficult to reproduce.

I found that Rule 10 is hardest to follow. 
Some of the data has some privacy restrictions.
