Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Pick one of the papers Retraction Watch features on their website and describe what went wrong**. 

I would like to discuss a paper " “Nitrate use and changes in bone mineral density: the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study,” by Abida Sophina Jamal.
Abida, a Toronto based scientist, used to have a promising career in osteoporosis research. However, she had committed series of flaws in her research papers, leading to a lifetime funding ban.
The data in the paper was so inconsistent with the raw data so reviewers suspected serious data manipulation. 


2. **After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not follow in your future projects.**
The most critical rule would be Rule #1 "For Every Result, Keep Track of How It Was Produced." I also discussed this issue, version control in Blog 1 as well because that was my biggest concern when it comes to team projects or independent research.
However, it would be challenging for me to follow Rule #2, "Avoid Manual Data Manipulation Steps" since this is sometimes necessary. 
For example, in 579 team project, my team members had to clean messy data on text dataset. It was more efficient to conduct manual data manipulation rather than automated process.
