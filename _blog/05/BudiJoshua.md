## Background:


In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 

## Prompt:

Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    Peng observed that many scientists and studies have paid little attention in the importance of reproducibility of the study. Especially, as computing tools are becoming more advanced, 
data analysis and modelling becomes more complex, thus leaving only final results becoming harder to understand and hard to follow the logic. The increasing and widening of capability of computing
amongst scientists may have caused more customized and intricate analyses too that would need a lot of documentation for other readers to understand. Thus, Biostatistics would like to provide better 
infrastructure to help this process such as access and aid in dissemination of data, code, and other general reproducubility endeavors. 

    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    That the wish to make reproducibility happens might not be as simple or as innocent as Peng has laid out. With much of the method-driven statistical research that has come about lately, 
it is more important to focus on the more substantive matter of the method-driven research than simply the ability to reanalyze datasets. Kielding argues that this is the part of the research
that is going to be more crucial to be able to be reproduced. 

    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    The comment by Cox and Donnelly I think is on point, because I get them that the purpose of having your code available to public is not so that people can just merely rerun the analysis to make 
sure it works and it is not manipulative, rather it is highly beneficial for other subject-matter scientists to discuss further and deeper, which leads to broadening of science and knowledge. 
   
   4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
   Keiding largely agrees with Cox and Donnelly, and agrees to the proposal to Biostatistics from Peng, but with misformulation of names and objectives. 

2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
  In my experience so far, my challenge has largely been in understanding the excel data sheet that my peer shared to me. It is often lacking the documentation of the variables it is listed as, making
understanding of the data becomes much harder. I can luckily just ask them in person here easily but I can imagine how hard it gets when collaborating with someone from far away. Other than that, different analysis and data organization due to different statistical 
software that is being used is also often hard to cooperate together on. If I can go back in time, I would make a standard variable names and/or excel structure/format for the lab that I work with to ease data editing between different people.
