Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    In the article, "Reproducible research and Biostatistics", the author Roger D. Peng introduced three different criteria the Associate Editor for reproducibility (AER) used to evaluate the reproducibility for an article in Biostatistics. The three criteria are Data, Code, and Reproducible. In the article, the author Peng also tell the readers some instructions for these three criteria. To be specific, the authors do not have to meet all these three criteria, they can only meet one criterion. For the data set and code, when the author is submitting, they should use the open and documented format. For meeting the "reproducible" criterion, the author should submit all the necessary material to let AER can produce the output. 
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
    In Niels Keiding's article "Reproducible research and the substantive context", he gave the response and comments for the Peng's article. He came up with several questions. For example, Is it enough and serious for other people to use the same code and data set to check on reproducibility? The main criticisms he had was the lack of consciousness for the importance of substantive context for all statistician. The reanalysis not only need to use the code and data set the author provided to check the reproducibility, but also need to understand the substantive context and familiar with the data. He pointed out that if we do not focus on the real context, it may intensify the academic inbreeding.
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
    I have read D.R.Cox's commentary about reproducible reseach, and I think his commentary is the most convincing. That is because in his aritcle, he combined both desirable parts from both articles. In Peng's article, proving data set and code is one necessary way for readers to understand the author and research. However, how to use and understand the data set and code should get some advices from Keiding's aricle. 
    
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
    Keiding agreed with Cox's ideas, and also indicated that it is welcome for more and more proposals for Biostatistics. In Keiding's response to the commentary article, he again serves to emphasize the earlier point the importance of the professional contact between the statistician and substantive researchers. 
    
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

  Last year, I have been work with one professor to do research about small area estimators. We found one article called "Comparison of unit level and area level small area estimators ". The most prominent issues we have was we were confused about some parts of the article, even if the article provided the process and the data they used. If I can go back, I would like to know the code the article used and also talk with the author about the confusing part of the article. It also just matches that Keiding's opinion, applied statistical work should require close contact between the statistician and other researchers.
