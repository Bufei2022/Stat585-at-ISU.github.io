Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    According to Peng's suggestion, the reproducibility is one of the useful tools to develop the comparative analysis and help to avoid from replication where some processes cannot be repeated due to financial, time or other crucial aspects of the experiment. The idea stated that the reader should be able to reproduce the results by using provided material and check it for adequacy. In addition, the author indicated that the general standard for reproducibility should be established in order to prevent publishing fraudulent research and receiving errors in the results. The three important aspects of reproducibility are available data, a reference to a script and reproducing similar results. Moreover, the researcher should provide a piece of additional auxiliary information about the data and computer code in a readable format.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
    The author mentioned that reproducibility might improve the level of documentation of original research data that allow us to receive reseanoble calculation. However, it is not only providing corrections, but it is also analyzing deeply and choosing the correct model. In addition,the author stated that the inductive method is more beneficial than the deductive method since problem-driven research has been conducted under the collaboration between substantive scientists and statisticians. It means collaborative effort will develop to find new substantive evidence and new statistical method will be applied.
  
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
    The comment stated by Christl Donnelly is most speaks to me since the author mentioned the main difference between illustrating the result and analyzing the data. Overall, it is agreed to support the general standard of reproducibility but it is related to the subject of study. The author mentioned that some researcher does not have a right to disclose information about individuals without their permission. It was pointed out that providing the whole dataset should not be the primary intention, analyzing the paper deeply and sharing the subject-matter to develop new methods should have more priority.  
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
     The author mentioned in the response that the researchers understand the purpose of providing additional information about the dataset. In addition, Keiding also supportive of the conclusion which is related to general regulation before publishing a paper and conducting the analysis after a paper published in Biostatistics sphere. Therefore, they are welcome to formulate the minimal standard platform that allows reproducing the outcome with additional materials.
     
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
    
     I have taken some courses when we use a different type of datasets in our assignments.  The collaborative effort required to solve group based assignments.  However, the main drawback of our attempts were dividing the problem by peace and combine the result at the end. The students had a different version of the software and a wide range of application that does not reproduce the outcome of the members identically.  The generating the result and analyzing each part of the assignment was unproductive and time-consuming.  If I had a chance to involve the same project or assignment,  I would encourage to use the same Github repository that allow working remotely without altering the original version of the project.
