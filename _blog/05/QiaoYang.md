Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    Roger Peng pointed out the reproducibility in Biostatistics. He introduced three dimensions of reproducibility: data, code and reproducible, so that AER could reproduce the results of research. Some examples are provided.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    We should focus more on research and substantive context than statistical analysis. And we should avoid using poorly informed old data set.
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    Reproducibility is important for avoiding computing errors. Only we can reproduce the results, we can check even improve the results of analysis.
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    He did not agree with Donoho's. He thinks Donoho does not explicitly mention how these policies should interface with the substantive context and the interdisciplinary collaborative groups.
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

    I did a project using OpenAI environment. My teammates had different results with mine, even running my code on their computer. I don't know why, and just let it go. Maybe it is because of the different package version which leads to the different data and calculation.
