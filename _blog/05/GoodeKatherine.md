# Part 1

### Question 1

**Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*

Peng suggests that authors should be required to submit both the data and code used for the analysis. Additionally, a referee should be able to use the code and data provided to rerun the analysis and acquire the same results as shown in the paper.

### Question 2

**What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**

Keiding argues that Peng's outline for reproducibility is too simplistic since only the numbers get checked instead of using of substantive knowledge to check the accuracy of the study. A study could have gone wrong in many places prior to the analysis, and he feels that an individual who has subject specific knowledge should be in involved to determine if there are additional issues with the study.

### Question 3

**Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**

The point made by Steven Goodman that "The key word in Dr Peng's editorial (Peng, 2009) that should have redirected Dr. Keiding's ire is the description of reproducible research standards as “minimal.”" resonated the most with me. This is exactly the thought I had while reading through Keiding's response. Unfortunately, we do not live in a world where there is enough funding and time to go through a study with a fine tooth comb or to reproduce the study in its entirety. It seems that Peng's guidelines provide a reasonable baseline, and with time, reproducibility could move more towards the standards Keiding's wishes to see.

### Question 4

**How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**

Keiding agrees with the statement that the standards are in fact "minimal", and he appears to accept Goodman's argument that these minimal standards will be an improvement over the current situation.

Keiding's main points in his response is that he believes there is an agreement in the fact that (1) old datasets should stop being reused over and over again for new statistical development and (2) applied statisticians should work closely with the scientist to have a good understanding of the scientific matter.

# Part 2  

### Question 1

**Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

While doing reserach, I feel like the goals of the project are ever evovoling over time. This has made it hard to organize the data that is output from the procedures I have run and my results. I have now started to keep "journals" of all the work that I do. These allow me to document my thought processes and store research paths that didn't work out or are still being worked on. I have had to go backwards and create earlier journals from work that I did at the beginning, and the amount of documentation that I inlcude in these is less than I would like since I am trying to hurry through the process to get back to the current material I am working on. If I could go back, I would have started this process at the beginning of my reserach.
