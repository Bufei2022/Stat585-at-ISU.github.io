## Background:


In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 

## Prompt:

Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    Peng encourage authors to submit the data and code along with their paper to ensure the reproducibility of the paper. The basic dimensions for reproducibility including data available, code available, and reproducible result based on code and data provided. 
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    Keiding's main criticisms are that, if the code and data are made available, people will have less motivation to come up with new approaches to analyse the data. And the reliability of the research result could be ensured by encouraging cooperation of statisticians and biologist.
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    The reproducibility is the minimum requirement.  Although there are many other reasons that can lead to the unreliable conclusion drawn from the data, to check the reproducibility an easy way to ensure the analysis procedure reported is working.
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are the main points in his response?**
    He says that people will not try to find their own way to analyze the data if the code is published. This policy will limit the potential for better methods of being invented. 
    
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
I was working on a course project with team members. The most prominent issue we had was related to the data being processed by team members that didn't share with the rest of the team. Sometimes, team members just share the code based on the processed data but forgot to share the processed data and the code for data processing. It leads to some mistakes in the final result when trying to reproduce the data. Good things are, it was not a complicated project, and the problem was easy to fix. 

## Instructions:

Update your forked version of the 'blog-2019' repository (or re-fork it after deleting your previous repo).

Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post! 

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository. Do not commit the compiled HTML file to the repository.
