## Background:


In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 

## Prompt:

Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    Reproducibility measures whether an entire study or experiment can be reproduced in its entirety. If we repeat the entire experiment with another sample group of experimental units and achieve similar results, then we can say that origianl study is reproducible. However, the problem is that most of the scientific studies have proven to be irreprodubible. Roger Peng pointed out three dimensions of reproducibility in Biostatistics, Data, Code and Reproducible. 
    
    Data: Data (Raw or modified) publicly available.
    Code: Codes used to produce the results should be publicly available.
    Reproducible: People in charge should be able to reproduce the findings. 
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
 He criticizes "Code", one of three dimensions of reporducibility in Biostatistics. He states that statistical computing is insignificant part of scientific studies, so checking codes alone will not be suitable in examining reproducibility. 
    
    
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
 Releasing data to the public would be appropriate, but providing oversimplified data does not help. One of the assignments for Stat 565(Epidemiology and Biostatistics) was to replicate a research finding of a clinical study. This was a difficult process because I only had access to oversimplifed dataset. They also did not provide what statistical analysis they actually used. 
  
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
    He appreciated most of the comments. However, he did not agree with some of the arguements, especially with Roger Peng and Donoho. 
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

In 579 Final project, we worked on a raw dataset from a speed dating experiment. We had to clean the data manually so I think reproducebility would be an issue when it comes to the dataset. What I would do is to record data manipulation steps in detail.
