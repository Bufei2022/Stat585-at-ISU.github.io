1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    There are 3 criteria for reproducibility.
    Data: Making the main data available on the journal's website.
    Code: Providing any computer code and other computer instructions used to compute the published result.
    Reproducible: Considering reasonable bounds for numerical tolerance, if the AER can succeed in producing the matched result by executing the data and code, then the article is reproducible. 
    Then he gave some materials for satisfying these criteria and an example.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
    Keiding's main criticism is that reproducibility will not guarantee the development of science. It is ridiculous to check the reproducibility through checking the calculations by using the same code and the same data as the original computer did without understanding the substantive context and the data.
    Mostly, the “method-driven” research just use data example to run a simulation study to see their justification works well, which will ignore the substantive problems that need to be solved. On the contrary, the “problem-driven” research will develop the method, and involve the substantive evidence and new directions which need collaboration between substantive scientists and statisticians. This type of research should be preferred.
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
    I think Cox and Donnelly's commentary indicated the critical point. They said the purpose of providing the full data was not primarily to encourage repetition of analyses. Instead, it is to encourage to discuss with interdisciplinary specialists and bring up new questions. Now making data and code available for the public is indeed encouraged in some fields. 
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
    Keiding fully agreed with their conclusion: "the proposals for Biostatistics are to be welcomed even though their name and objectives are misformulated". He thought the primary purpose of Biostatistics is right. But they should focus on using methods to extract important information from data rather than using data to illustrate methods. It is best that substantive scientists and statisticians cooperate with each other to find some new methods and new directions to solve substantive problems.
    
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

Several years ago, I was assigned to do part of the data analysis for the field investigation which I did not participate in. I spent almost one month to do some analysis according to the given description. Then I encountered some problems and couldn't go on. After I contacted the students who did the experimental analysis, one of them found a mistake they made. So I had to start over to correct it. If I could go back in time, I would communicate with them before I began my work.
