Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 

      There are three dimensions of reproducibility in *Biostatistics*: data, code and reproducible. Data that are used in analysis could be available on the journal's website if authors get permission to publish them. All computer codes need to be provided. Authors could provide supplementary materials to let Associate Editor for reproducibility (AER) execute codes and reproduce the results.

    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
      I think Keiding's main criticisms is the proposal puts too much weights on the correctness of calculation in terms of "reanalysis". "Research" is not only statistical analysis and statistical analysis is not only getting the correct numbers. When we are considering reanalysis, we should put more efforts on the substantive context.


    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
    The commentary of D. R. Cox speaks to me the most. The reason is Cox pointed that the purpose of providing the full data is not only to reproduce the calculation but also to help specialists find the formulation and investigation of new questions. I think this point speaks to me because that's a way to bring our field forward.   

    4. __How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?__
    
      Keiding states that Cox acknowledges there are various of purposes of making data available and fully agree with their conclusion. Keiding's main points in his response is that he didn't claim reproduction of computational aspects is trival and he blames many papers whose authors is lack of understanding the substantive details.
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

    I had a course project last semester. My teammate and I couldn't get the same number even with the same data, the same code and the same seed. Our laptops have different operating systems. But on one laptop, the results were replicable. Our solution was using only one laptop. We didn't solve that problem and if I could go back I would test the codes on two different machines using the same operating system to see if operating system is the one causing the problem.
