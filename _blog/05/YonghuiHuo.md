## Background:




1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
In this article, Roger Peng tell us how to  meet a standard of reproducibility for resreach, such as the analytic data from which the principal results were derived should be available on the journal's Web site, any computer code, software, or other computer instructions that were used to compute published results should be provided. Then he give instructions to the authors and tell them how to do this and hold a example to his view point.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    ***Keiding think that the term "reproducible" is a misnomer.There is usually much more to "research" than the statistical analysis, and there is much more to the statistical analysis than the correctness of calculations. Poeple should avoid encouraging the already far too widespread occurrence of poorly informed reanalyses of old data sets.
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    ***I like the point of "working reproducibly can avoid the computing errors". Since we may find some errors by working reproducibly, other people can also do this by reproduce our research, in this way, we can avoid many errors and letting our result convienced by people.
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    ***Keiding think that Donoho does not explicitly mention how the substantive context interfaced with the interdisciplinary collaborative groups that are usually necessary to generate scientific results of importance. He also think that there is no space for imagination for working reproducibly.
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
   ***When I praticipate a project last year, I did same part with one of my teammates in this project. But after comparing, his coding part is more effective and shorter than me. What I did was just deleted my code and copied his part. But if I can go back in time, I will learn how his code working and try to understand his programming ideas. I believe I can improve my coding ability if I do this.  
## Instructions:

Update your forked version of the 'blog-2019' repository (or re-fork it after deleting your previous repo).

Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post! 

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository. Do not commit the compiled HTML file to the repository.
