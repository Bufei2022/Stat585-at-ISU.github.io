1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    Roger D. Peng cite the Associate Editor for reproducibility's three dimensions, such as Data, code and reproducible, to provide some level of continuity between "not reproducible" and "reproducible." Also, he promoted authors to provide supplementary material and open and documented formats of data set and code to increase the reproducibility. Finally, he provided four criterions for ensuring the reproducibility in term of  integrity of executing files.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    
    With a pespective of utilitarianism,Keiding claim that "reproducible"" is a misnomer, becuase the substantive context should be more concerned than the reproducibity. He explained that the reprocution doesn't guarantee to benefit science, because there is more research than the statistical analysis, and is even more imporatant than the correctness of calculations. Giving a comparision to deductive method-driven research, he stated that the inductive problem-driven research make more progress, where the correctness of calculations are often ensured by the collaboration between statistician and substantivescientist. He also emphasized the important responsibility of biostatistics by criticizing the reanalysis through verifying the correctness of the calculation without awareness of the prehistory of the study, such as reliability of the data and the input quality of collaboration between researchers. 
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
    The counter points between two kind of mind surely impress me. To my understanding, let's call Roger D. Peng's side is liberal, and the Keiding's side is conservative. Among the commentaries, I am more interested in *D. R. Cox* and *Christl Donnelly*'s idea that "the purpose of providing the full data was not primarily to encourage repetition of our own analyses", that is "the matter specialists, the formulation and investigation of new questions", so the idea in the proposal is welcome, but should not be mandatory. For editors, learners,  distributors, the proposals of reproducibility is favored, whereas for authors, beneficiaries, it is dislike. The reason I like this commentary is that, based on the honesty of the authors and correctness of calculations, with understanding that the whether the data and the detail method are opened to publich is sorted into individual rights, the donation of the personal resource is welcome, but is a personal choise. If the loyalty of honesty is no more exist, the system of scientific research is trash no mater how much resource of experise is inputed. 
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
    The Keiding respond to the Cox and Donnelly's commentary with fully agreement. It maches my assumption that Keilding will compromise thier thought of encourage but not mandatory. 
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

    In my experience wtith the data intensive project, I have a issue of how frequency of updating the intermediate result to my advisor. My concern is that my advisor would not reproduce my result untill I acomplish all the method, then how should I do with it. So what i did is to turn in the unfunctional code. Now, I will constantly communicate with her about my idea, and update my progress with new thought.
