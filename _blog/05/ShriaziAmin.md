#### Part I
  1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in Biostatistics.**
  Peng has an idea to define some standards for reproducibility which involves three different dimensions. These are Data, Code and Reproducible from which any results derived in the published article can be reproduced. 
  
  2. ** What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?.**
  Keiding agrees with the idea of reproducibility, but has also some comments abou it. He believes we should avoid encouraging the already far too widespread occurence of not well-known reanalysis of the data sets where not many statisticians know much about. He explains that the two major research types in biostatistics have different approaches and it might be bothering to the editors of journals.
    
  3.**Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
  Steven N. Goodman's commentary was in accord with Keiding's point of view that it is not easy to judge a real scientific research project by only skimming the calculations in the article. He believes there are technical details in researches which cannot be reported for reproducibility. He also has a criticism in the reproducibility standards that Peng's suggested as the three principles are not easy to implement in even simple cases. He concludes then that those principles are minimal.  
    
  
  4.** How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response? ** 
  He accepts Goodman's point about the difficulty ( and maybe impossibility) of generalizing the results in every case. He also agrees that bettter documentation of the computations will enhance the quality of statistical refereeing in subject- matter journals. 
  
#### part II
  2**.Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on dta related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
  In a research project with my advisor back in my country, we were working on some new hypothetical statistics to apply stochastic differential equations in general, and in stock market data in particular. Our intention was to apply the tests on high frequency data, so we used simulation to generate some data for our initial work. I used different methods to generate data, and finally picked the simplest one and did not keep the source and codes for other approaches. Later on, during working on another similar research, I needed a complicated and powerful source of simulation. I was happy that I had already worked on it, but dissappointed not to store the codes for reproduction.
