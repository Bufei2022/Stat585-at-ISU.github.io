Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*.  
    
    As research to find a signal from complex is getting complex in biostatistics, what Roger Peng think matters is reproducible research provided by making data sets and computer code available to the public for the papers published. The author especially encourages for researchers to submit the code written for an open software in a main script, supplementary code files, the data sets, and a file called a "target" file that allows for reviewers to examine the reproducibility of the results in the submitted papers.  
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**.  
    
    Since science including statistical analyses is more than calculation, the professionalism and the insightful thoughts from interdisciplinary group of researchers as well as statisticians is necessarily introduced to research in biostatistics. Thus, the goal of technical reproducibility of analytic results would disregard the context of research and lead to the disparagement of biostatistics.  
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**  
    
    The persepectives of David Donoho and Catherine Deangelis makes sense to me the most. The suggestions from Roger Peng have some impractical aspects such as providing a single R code for main results when considering that research in biostatistics is conducted in a heavily interative way. Even so, scientific research should be systematically documented and conducted in a tranparent way with appropriate checks and restraint through independent entities.  
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**  
    
    According to Keiding, Donoho does not provide specific ways for systematic documentation of the substantive context and the interdisciplinary collaborative work.  
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

- My previous research was comparing the responses by three survey modes where the target population was the entire students in my university. The project was sponsored by the school, and the list of all of the current students including the private information such as contact, major, age and so on. Setting the contact aside, such demographic information was used for main analysis to compare population and samples, and some combination of the demographics could identify some specific individuals. Based on this project, one paper was published and if the submission of the complete data was requested at that time, I don't think that it would have been available as they are due to the privacy issues which would not be considered reproducible research in some ways based on Roger Peng's view. If I go back in time, and would be asked to make the data available to the public, I would look into the methods regarding on the privacy security to avoid identifying individuals uniquely from data in the favor of publishing the data.
