Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    Roger Peng pointed out three rules for reprobility in biostatistics paper.
    The author should ensure the data is accessible for public. 
    The code, software or other computer instructions should be provided. 
    The result could be reproducible within a reasonable bounds.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
    Keiding think that encouraging to conduct "alternative analyses" is misnorm and less innocent than look at first glance. This "reproduction" may not benefit science.
    There is much more research than statitical analysis, and it's more important for statistical analysis than the correctness of calculations.
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    Steven N. Goodman's commentary spoke to me most. He emphasizes that his provisions for reproducibility are minimal. They didn't ask for a reproducible research document, but ask the author whether they will to share their protocol, data, and code. They allow the author say no, but this still allows flexibility and power of choice for the researchers, and improve transparency of the process.
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    Keiding was persuaded by Goodman's point. he agree that better documentation of the computations will enhance the quality of statistical refereeing in subject-matter journals.
    
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**
My project is a complicated genomic data analysis. I need report some analysis to my boss weekly. Usually, I make some plot for my finding. However, when I writing paper and reorganize my result, I find it's very important to make a good documentation for each step and code.
Since the bioinformatics software usually have problem when change a computer, upgrade a version, or just change a dataset. I always spend a lot of time to figure out bugs everytime I rerun a similar code. If I can go back, I will make a documentation for each step, and record the version, and bugs everytime I met.
