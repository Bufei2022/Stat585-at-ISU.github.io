Write a blog post addressing the questions: 


1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
        Three dimensions of reproducibility were proposed: data, code and reproducible.
        
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
       Research should be more problem-driven and substantive context in comparison to statistical analysis. It is not wise to use poorly informed old data set.
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
       I think reproducibility is more important. Reproducibility can not only avoid error but also be used to identify new prblem. 
    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
       Keiding did not agree with Donoho's idea. He thinks Donoho does not explicitly mention how these policies should interface with the substantive context and the interdisciplinary collaborative groups.
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

    I remember a team project with four collaborators from different major. One collaborator likes to manipulate the dataset by changing the raw data rather than coding without letting everyone know. Even though the project was fun, the reproducibility of the result was definitely a big concern. Back to the time, I will emphasize the importance of reproducibility to make sure the raw data can not change.
