## Background:


In 2009 one of the associate editors of Biostatistics, Roger Peng, outlined a new policy of [reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014) for the journal. 

This triggered a response from one of the other associated editors, Niels Keiding, and subsequently a large part of volume 11, issue 3 of Biostatistics was dedicated to a discussion of issues of redproducibility. 

## Prompt:

Read through 

- Roger Peng's [initial editorial](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp014), 

- [Keiding's response](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq033),

- its five [commentaries](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/issue/11/3),  

- Roger Peng's [response to Keiding](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq032)

- and finally, Keiding's [response to the commentaries](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq034)

Don't worry about the number of papers listed - these papers are all very short and easy reads. 


Write a blog post addressing the questions: 

1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    Peng proposed to set up a minimum standard that can fulfill the need for publishing reproducible research. He described the efforts that Biostatistics is making to promote reproducibility in biostatistical research. The AER consider three different criteria when evaluating the reproducibility of an article: data, code, reproducible. Peng also gave a detailed list of all necessary materials the authors need to submit to satify the "reproducible" criterion. 
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 
Keiding thought the lacking of deep insight into the substantive context would make the "reproduction" less beneficial for the science.  
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**

Donoho describes systematic attempts at getting innovations in statistical computing made reproducible by drastically improving the level of documentation during the whole research process and all the way to the publications. These efforts are highly commendable and long overdue. Donoho claims—credibly—that reproducible research will have higher impact and is here seconded by Breslow.  

    
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**

  Donoho does not explicitly mention how these policies should interface with the substantive context and the interdisciplinary collaborative groups that are usually necessary to generate scientific results of importance. The optimistic view is that any improvement in level of documentation will also benefit data quality and its transmissibility not only in the publication but in the long run also in the conduct of much research, as explained by Donoho in his context.
  
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

In our PFG project, the weekly factor data are internal. The company does not allow us to share the data source. We would provide the data description if possible.
