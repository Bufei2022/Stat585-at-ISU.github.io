1. **Answer each of the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences.**

    1. **Summarize Roger Peng's outline for reproducibility in** *Biostatistics*. 
    
    Author considered 3 dimentions for reproducibility, which are 1- Data :used for the analysis 2- Code: that generates the result in the paper 3-Reproducible: An article is reproducible if the AER is able to reproduce the result given in the paper with some tolerance. The material needed are 1-main script: this may load the data and call other functions 2- other required code file calle by main script 3- data file 4- target file containing the results.
    
    2. **What are Keiding's main criticisms of the proposal?**. 

   Keiding thinks that this way of reproduction would not benefit science and he thinks there is much more in to research than statistical analysis and statistical analysis is more than just calculation. choise of method requires deep insight into the data. and he is not sure how new system is able to capture the correctness of the choises in methodologies. moreover he thinks statistician doesnt know much about datasets and so they cant interpret. he thinks reproducibility is more than just checking the calculation and the code if it does reflect the given output.
   
    
    3. **Which point in the commentaries speaks to you the most? Why?**
    
I agree with Norman E. Breslow as reproducibility is not just numbers, there are serious problems involve like  selection bias, measurement error, uncontrolled confounding, and small sample size, that affect the results. and having old data sets available to study methods is useful, but such data sets are not related to current science.
    4. **How does Keiding respond to the commentary you picked. What are his main points in his response?**
    
    The Keiding respond to the Norman E. Breslow's commentary with fully agreement.
    
2. **Describe your experience with a data intensive (collaborative) project. What are the most prominent issues with ensuring reproducibility of research results (focus on data related aspects)? What would you do differently if you could go back in time?**

chosen methods need to fit to the data set closely, as im working on it i would try to reach for feedback on methods and i would try to test whether result make sence and they are logical as i can.
