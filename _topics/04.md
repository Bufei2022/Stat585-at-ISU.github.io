## Prompt:

Dates and times can be difficult to work with. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY) to appreciate all of the fun scenarios that date/time libraries have to accommodate.

Luckily, the `lubridate` package makes working with dates and times in R relatively straightforward. The package has been described in the paper [Working with date and time](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i03/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, an updated version of an intro to lubridate can be found in chapter 16 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html). Read one of the two sources.

Write a blog post addressing the questions:


1. **Describe what intervals, durations, periods, and instants are, and give one example for each that shows why we need these distinctions.**
2. **The `ggplot2` package works seamlessy with lubridate. Find a data set with dates and/or times, use lubridate to work with the dates/times, then plot a time-related aspect of the data and describe it.**
