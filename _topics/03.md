## Prompt:

The `plyr` package has by now been replaced by other, even faster packages, but the idea of *Split, apply, combine* is as relevant as ever.

Read the paper [The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) by Hadley Wickham.


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **The R code for the split-apply-combine paper is posted with the paper. Pick one of the examples demonstrating `plyr` functionality (such as dlply or ddply, ...) and rewrite the example using functionality from the package `dplyr`. Make sure that your example actually works.**

2. **Which (base R) functions do you know that support the split-apply-combine strategy? In your opinion, are these sufficient? State why or why not?**. 


3. **In 50 to 100 words describe the split-apply-combine paradigm.**
 

Submit to your repo. Make sure that all of the github actions pass (check menu item Actions - all of the actions should have green checks)
